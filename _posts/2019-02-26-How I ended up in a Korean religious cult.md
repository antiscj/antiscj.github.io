This is quite an unusual story, as it is my account of how I ended up in a religious cult in South Korea and how I walked out of it. It has been a most interesting experience, but not without any fear. My story provides an insight in how religious cults can function and serves as a warning for others, who might find themselves in a similar situation one day.

这是一个非常不寻常的故事，因为这是我对韩国宗教崇拜的结局以及我如何走出它的说法。这是一次最有趣的经历，但并非没有任何恐惧。我的故事提供了一个洞察宗教邪教如何运作的信息，并作为对其他人的警告，他们可能有一天会发现自己处于类似情况。

Via a colleague I received an invitation to attend a ‘world peace summit’, in Seoul, South Korea, in my capacity as president of a youth organization in the Netherlands. The three-day event aimed to bring together representatives from governments, religions and youth organizations, in order to ‘discuss and create an interfaith constitution for peace’. The members of the youth organizations would also meet separately, to discuss peaceful actions in their communities. The organization, officially called ‘Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL)’, paid 80% of the plane ticket. The official name sounded a bit sketchy to me, looking at the religious connotation, but there would be discussions and it was staged as a secular event. By googling the name of the organization I could not find much, as it was going to be organized for the first time. Eventually, the prospect of discussing actions for more peaceful societies, meeting representatives from youth organizations from all over the world and seeing the country convinced me to join the peace summit.

通过一位同事，我以荷兰青年组织主席的身份，收到了在韩国首尔参加“世界和平峰会”的邀请。为期三天的活动旨在汇集各国政府，宗教和青年组织的代表，以“讨论并制定一项促进和平的宗教间宪法”。青年组织的成员也将分别举行会议，讨论其社区的和平行动。该组织正式名为“天文化，世界和平，光明复兴”（HWPL），支付了80％的机票。官方名称对我来说听起来有些粗略，看着宗教内涵，但会有讨论，并且它被作为一个世俗事件上演。通过Google搜索我找不到的组织名称，因为它将是第一次组织。最终，有可能为更和平的社会讨论行动，与来自世界各地的青年组织的代表会面，并看到该国说服我加入和平峰会。

Upon arrival at the airport I was welcomed by a big group of members of the organization, which was quite a surprise. All day attendants of the Summit were arriving, and they got a warm welcome. I was asked to go on a picture with ‘my’ arrival team, together with two persons in big suits, like mascots. Well, the picture explains it best. After that we went straight to a conference location, where a preparation meeting was held, with the representatives of youth organizations. There was a lot of media and a main speech was given by a man of senior age, Mr. Man Hee Lee, the ‘honorary chairman’ of the organization. He was introduced as a father figure to the youth and as a peace maker, as he travelled around the world to spread the message of peace. Allegedly he had all the answers to achieve world peace, but what that exactly meant did not become clear yet, except that we should all unite to make peace. I discussed with some colleagues that it did not feel very promising, but probably we could advocate for different strategies and bottom-up approaches in the next meetings.

抵达机场后，我受到该组织一大群成员的欢迎，这是一个令人惊讶的事。首脑会议的全天服务员都到了，他们受到了热烈的欢迎。我被要求与“我的”抵达团队一起拍照，还有两个穿着大西装的人，比如吉祥物。嗯，图片解释得最好。之后，我们直接前往会议地点，与青年组织的代表举行了筹备会议。有很多媒体和一位高龄人士，该组织的“名誉主席”Man Hee Lee先生发表了主要演讲。他作为一个父亲形象被介绍给年轻人和和平制造者，因为他周游世界传播和平的信息。据称他拥有实现世界和平的所有答案，但是，除了我们都应该团结起来以实现和平之外，这究竟意味着什么还没有变得清晰。我与一些同事讨论过，它感觉不太乐观，但我们可能会在下次会议中倡导不同的策略和自下而上的方法。

We stayed in a hotel outside the city and the next day we drove with busses to a parking lot, next to a big stadium, which turned out to be the main stadium built for the 1988 Summer Olympics. We were asked to wear traditional clothes from our countries. As I am from the Netherlands and we do not really have a traditional outfit, I was wearing an orange shirt of our national team. Others were wearing the most colorful clothes, making quite an impression, also taking in mind we were with around 300 people. Still we were not sure what exactly we were going to do.

我们住在城外的一家酒店，第二天我们开着公共汽车去了一个停车场，旁边是一个大型体育场，后来成为1988年夏季奥运会的主体育场。我们被要求穿着来自我们国家的传统服装。因为我来自荷兰，而且我们没有传统服装，所以我穿着国家队的橙色衬衫。其他人穿着色彩鲜艳的衣服，给人留下了相当深刻的印象，同时考虑到我们有大约300人。我们还不确定我们到底要做什么。

The stadium turned out to be fully packed (capacity 70.000), and we walked in via the athletes entrance, with cheering crowds and fireworks. Amazed at what we were experiencing, we took pictures and videos (please find a great one below), fearing that nobody would believe us if we did not. We were directed to a prominent place in the stadium, where we heard a couple of speeches and we witnessed some impressive show elements, with music, dances and fireworks. Most special was the ‘human LCD’ card performance, in which hundreds of Korean youngsters depicted different ‘moving’ scenes. An American rabbi held an interesting speech, in which he continuously repeated “Let peace reign”, for example after some statement about Israel, but without any realism. Every time the crowd was cheering, but we noticed that was strange, since the crowd was mostly very young and many of them could probably not understand English (also older people usually had trouble with English). In front of every section however, there was a person who ‘directed’ that part of the audience: if he or she started screaming, everybody would follow. The main speech was again from Mr. Man Hee Lee, where I found out the real intentions behind the gathering. Previously Man Hee Lee spoke about “uniting all youngsters to achieve peace”, but now it became clear how exactly: by uniting under his religion.

体育场原来是满满的（容量70.000），我们走进运动员入口，欢呼的人群和烟花。对我们所经历的事情感到惊讶，我们拍摄了照片和视频（请在下面找到一个很棒的照片和视频），担心如果我们不这样做，没有人会相信我们。我们被引导到体育场的一个显眼的地方，在那里我们听到了几个演讲，我们目睹了一些令人印象深刻的表演元素，音乐，舞蹈和烟花。最特别的是“人类液晶”卡的表现，其中数百名韩国年轻人描绘了不同的“移动”场景。一位美国犹太教教士举行了一次有趣的演讲，他不断重复“让和平统治”，例如在对以色列发表一些声明之后，却没有任何现实主义。每次人群欢呼，但我们注意到这很奇怪，由于人群大多非常年轻，他们中的许多人可能不会理解英语（老年人通常也会遇到英语问题）。然而，在每个部分的前面，有一个人“指导”那部分观众：如果他或她开始尖叫，每个人都会跟随。主要讲话再次来自Man Hee Lee先生，在那里我发现了聚会背后的真实意图。以前，李万熙谈到“团结所有年轻人以实现和平”，但现在已经明确地说明了：通过团结在他的宗教之下。

He explained that he was sent as a messenger from heaven to deliver this message and that uniting under the one true God was the only way to solve conflicts. Diversity was the problem. At that moment I was sure that this ‘peace summit’ would not have a meaningful contribution. Back in the hotel I started googling to see if I could find more about Man Hee Lee and the movement. Some blogs (links below) explained that HWPL was actually a disguised body of the ‘Sincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony’, which Man Hee Lee founded in 1984. It is best described as a Christian cult, with dubious teachings on the bible. The organization infiltrates schools and other churches, to recruit new members and to indoctrinate them. For foreigners they organize free Korean lessons and leisure events. While these foreigners don’t know exactly who organizes these free activities, on photo and video material it seems that they support the Church. For similar reasons we were photographed so much in the stadium: we are excellent propaganda material for the South Korean people, showing them that Man Hee Lee has supporters from all over the world.

他解释说，他是从天上送来的信使，传递这个信息，在一个真正的上帝之下联合是解决冲突的唯一方法。多样性是问题所在。那一刻，我确信这次“和平峰会”不会有有意义的贡献。回到酒店，我开始谷歌搜索，看看我是否能找到更多关于Man Hee Lee和运动的信息。一些博客（下面的链接）解释说，HWPL实际上是一个伪装的“证言会幕圣殿耶稣神教堂”，Man Hee Lee于1984年成立。它最好被描述为一个基督教崇拜者，有着可疑的关于圣经的教导。该组织渗透到学校和其他教会，招募新成员并灌输他们。对于外国人，他们组织免费的韩语课程和休闲活动。虽然这些外国人并不确切知道是谁组织这些免费活动，但在照片和视频材料上似乎他们支持教会。出于类似的原因，我们在体育场拍摄了很多照片：我们是韩国人民的优秀宣传材料，向他们展示了Man Hee Lee拥有来自世界各地的支持者。

About those pictures it is interesting that they asked us to make a peace symbol with our hands, not the regular ‘V’, but with forefinger and thumb up, a bit like a gun. Most people did it without asking, but it turned out to be the symbol of the cult, again making beautiful PR material. While me and some other colleagues made plans to leave the conference, or at least to change our sleeping location to a hostel in the center, somebody from the organization came to talk to us. At that moment around half of the youth organization representatives had gathered in the only room where internet was available. Our points of critique were expressed, focusing on the lack of discussions, the exclusive approach and the religious character of the meeting. The manager listened to it and promised more discussions for the next day. But she also said that according to her we should be a bit happier maybe, as we were witnessing world history. And: if you are not for this peace summit, are you against peace? As we already lost our faith anyway, we booked the hostel.

关于那些照片，有趣的是，他们要求我们用手制作和平符号，而不是常规的“V”，但用食指和拇指向上，有点像枪。大多数人在没有询问的情况下做到了这一点，但事实证明它是邪教的象征，再次制作出漂亮的公关材料。当我和其他一些同事计划离开会议，或者至少将我们的睡眠地点改为中心的宿舍时，该组织的某些人来找我们。那时，大约一半的青年组织代表聚集在唯一可以上网的房间里。我们表达了我们的批评点，重点是缺乏讨论，独家方法和会议的宗教性质。经理听了它并承诺第二天会进行更多的讨论。但她也说，根据她的说法，我们应该有点快乐，因为我们正在目睹世界历史。并且：如果你不参加这次和平峰会，你是否反对和平？因为我们已经失去了信仰，我们预订了宿舍。

We were afraid to say the real reason that we left the hotel, so we just showed up in the morning with our suitcases. After the bus ride to the new conference location, we wanted to go first to the hostel, but our Protocol Officers explained it would be best to leave the suitcases in the baggage compartment in the bus, and pick it up at the end of the day, leaving us little choice. You need to know that every three or four participants in the summit were accompanied by two ‘Protocol Officers’. They check if you feel good and if you can find the way. It seemed very nice at first, but in fact they were all the time checking where you are, in other words trying to control you and the situation. After some time me and my rebellious colleagues went back to the bus anyway, to ask the driver if he could open the luggage compartment. He did it and we went to our booked hostel with a taxi. After dropping our suitcases in the hostel we got a bit lost in the Seoul subway, according to Wikipedia the longest metro system, but we made it back to the location.

我们不敢说我们离开酒店的真正原因，所以我们只是在早上带着行李箱出现。乘坐巴士到新会议地点后，我们想先去旅舍，但我们的礼宾人员解释说，最好将行李箱放在公共汽车的行李舱内，并在一天结束时把它拿起来。 ，让我们别无选择。你需要知道，峰会上每三到四名参与者都有两名“礼宾官”。他们检查你是否感觉良好，如果你能找到方法。起初看起来很不错，但实际上他们一直在检查你的位置，换句话说就是试图控制你和情况。过了一段时间，我和叛逆的同事们还是回到公交车上，询问司机是否可以打开行李箱。他做到了，我们带着出租车去了我们预订的宿舍。根据维基百科最长的地铁系统，在宿舍里放下手提箱之后我们在首尔地铁站丢了一点，但我们又回到了这个位置。

My Protocol Officers were happy that I was back, but they seemed frightened and even a bit desperate. Another colleague told me that he saw that my Protocol Officer had a strong conversation about my absence with her manager and afterwards she was in tears. In general the Protocol Officers and the other volunteers seemed constantly very tired, showing a big lack of sleep. During the last two evenings they often had briefings, while they did not even sleep at the hostel. The morning program consisted of a ceremony to sign a document, calling for the cessation of all wars. Effectively, smartly formulated, the document meant a submission of allegiance to the Sincheonji Church. There was quite some pressure to sign from the Protocol Officers, but I refused, explaining that I would have to discuss it with my organization first. After the lunch we were waiting for the planned discussions, but when again endless and pointless speeches were announced, me and some other colleagues left the summit for good. As I was still afraid to inform my Protocol Officers about the real reason (they could still cancel my plane ticket), we left pretty suddenly. I was sitting next to a Protocol Officer and I saw that she lost all the color in her face when I stood up to leave. She started calling quickly, as there is always a second Officer near the door, to stop people. But that person must have been gone for a moment, as we quickly walked towards the main exit.

我的礼宾人员很高兴我回来了，但他们似乎很害怕，甚至有点绝望。另一位同事告诉我，他看到我的礼宾官与我的经理谈了一次我的缺席，之后她哭了。一般来说，礼宾官员和其他志愿者似乎总是非常疲倦，显示出大量的睡眠不足。在过去的两个晚上，他们经常有简报，而他们甚至没有在宿舍睡觉。早上的节目包括签署文件的仪式，呼吁停止所有战争。该文件有效，巧妙地制定，意味着向Sincheonji教会提交忠诚。从议定书官员那里签下了相当大的压力，但我拒绝了，并解释说我必须首先与我的组织讨论。午餐后，我们正在等待计划的讨论，但是当我们再次宣布无休止和毫无意义的演讲时，我和其他一些同事一起离开了峰会。由于我仍然害怕告知我的礼宾官员真正的原因（他们仍然可以取消我的机票），我们突然离开了。我坐在一名礼宾官旁边，当我站起来离开时，我看到她脸上的颜色已经失去了。她开始快速打电话，因为门口附近总会有第二名警察阻止他们。但是那个人肯定已经离开了一会儿，因为我们很快就走向了主出口。由于我仍然害怕告知我的礼宾官员真正的原因（他们仍然可以取消我的机票），我们突然离开了。我坐在一名礼宾官旁边，当我站起来离开时，我看到她脸上的颜色已经失去了。她开始快速打电话，因为门口附近总会有第二名警察阻止他们。但是那个人肯定已经离开了一会儿，因为我们很快就走向了主出口。由于我仍然害怕告知我的礼宾官员真正的原因（他们仍然可以取消我的机票），我们突然离开了。我坐在一名礼宾官旁边，当我站起来离开时，我看到她脸上的颜色已经失去了。她开始快速打电话，因为门口附近总会有第二名警察阻止他们。但是那个人肯定已经离开了一会儿，因为我们很快就走向了主出口。

Outside, across the street, there were around 20 protesters, having big flags, warning people about the destructive aspects of the cult. Some of them were screaming at the top of their lungs towards the building, hoping that somebody would get their message. I spoke to a woman who was involved and she explained that her daughter was brainwashed by the organization and that she had not seen her for some years now. We left as quickly as possible, feeling sad about the whole adventure. I was still nervous if my return ticket was not going to be cancelled. We spent our last 1,5 day with sightseeing, but I could not enjoy so much anymore. From other Koreans we learned that there are more religious cults in South Korea, but they are exceptions and we should not judge the whole of South Korea with our experience.

在街对面外，大约有20名抗议者，有大旗，警告人们邪教的破坏性方面。他们中的一些人在他们的肺部尖叫着朝着建筑物尖叫，希望有人能得到他们的信息。我和一位参与其中的女人交谈过，她解释说她的女儿被该组织洗脑，而且她已经好几年没见过她了。我们尽快离开，对整个冒险感到悲伤。如果我的回程票不会被取消，我仍然感到紧张。我们花了最近1.5天的时间观光，但我不能再享受这么多了。从其他韩国人那里我们了解到韩国有更多的宗教信仰，但他们是例外，我们不应该用我们的经验判断整个韩国。

From some critical blogs I learned that the Sincheonji Church organizes these big events every couple of years or so, but every time under a new name. Every time the name of the event gets a lot of negative references afterwards, so they want to start with a clean sheet. Now, looking back, it was an enlightening experience to see how religious cults function from the inside. It reinforced my fear of collectivism and top-down approaches. Also it showed me once more how religion can be a destructive force. Of course I should have looked better into the real organization behind the peace summit and who sponsors it. Hopefully the next time the Sincheonji Church organizes such an event, under a new name probably, people will think twice. Ironically, in the end we indeed united as one, but then against Mr. Man Hee Lee and his deceiving practices.

从一些重要的博客中我了解到，新天地教会每隔几年左右就组织一次大型活动，但每次都以新的名字命名。每次事件的名称后来都会有很多负面的引用，所以他们想要从一个干净的工作表开始。现在，回顾过去，了解宗教信仰如何从内部发挥作用是一种启发性的体验。它加强了我对集体主义和自上而下方法的恐惧。它再一次向我展示了宗教如何成为一种破坏性的力量。当然，我应该更好地了解和平峰会背后的真正组织，并赞助它。希望下一次Sincheonji教会组织这样的活动，可能会以一个新的名字，人们会三思而后行。具有讽刺意味的是，最终我们确实团结一致，但随后又反对李万熙先生及其欺骗行为。
