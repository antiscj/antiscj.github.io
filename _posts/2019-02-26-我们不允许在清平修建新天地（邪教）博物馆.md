“We cannot allow a Shincheonji cult museum in Cheongpyeong!”

In resistance to the plan of Shincheonju Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony (Shincheonji) to build a museum on a large site in Cheongpyeong-myeon, Gapyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do, local church and citizens’ groups are acting to guard their area through various events including a seminar on cults and a walking rally. Shincheonji is campaigning for public support, arguing that a museum will benefit the local economy.

为了抵抗新天地在清平的一个大型遗址上建立博物馆，当地教会和公民团体通过各种活动保护他们的地区，包括关于邪教和步行集会的研讨会。新天地正在争取公众支持，认为博物馆将有利于当地经济。

On April 15, more than 850 believers from member churches of the Gapyeong Christian Council took part in a seminar at Cheongpyeong Church (Rev. Jang Ik-bong) on cult countermeasures, where the guest speaker was Rev. Shin Hyeon-uk (Guri Chodae Church), director of Guri Cult Counseling Center in Gyeonggi-do. “Shincheonji evangelizes through deceptive contacts camouflaged as interviews, club activities, cultural lectures, or career/faith/psychological counseling,” Rev. Shin said. “This heretical cult group believes that when the time comes, the souls of the martyrs and the bodies of Shincheonji believers will unite and enjoy immortal life for eternity.”

4月15日，来自加平基督教协会成员教会的850多名信徒参加了清平教会（Jang Ik-bong牧师）关于邪教对策的研讨会，嘉宾演讲者是Shin Hyeon-uk牧师（Guri Chodae）教会），京畿道Guri Cult咨询中心主任。“Shincheonji通过欺骗性的接触传播，通过采访，俱乐部活动，文化讲座或职业/信仰/心理咨询伪装，”Rev. Shin说。“这个邪教组织认为，到时候，烈士的灵魂和新天地信徒的身体将团结起来，享受不朽的永生。”

After the seminar, 1,100 some local church members and citizens took part in a walking rally (photo) sponsored by Cheongpyeong Citizens Solidarity For Shincheonji Countermeasures. Departing from Cheongpyeong Church, they proceeded to the museum construction site in Cheongpyeong 4-ri, holding pickets that read “Memorial to Shincheonji founder on scenic Cheongpyeong land? No way!”, “Cheongpyeong citizens are not fooled by Shincheonji group’s holy-land drive” and other slogans, and shouting their refusal to allow construction of the Shincheonji museum.

研讨会结束后，1,100名当地教会成员和市民参加了由清平公民团结新善对策赞助的步行集会（照片）。从清平教堂出发，他们前往位于清平4里的博物馆建筑工地，上面写着“在风景秀丽的清平土地上纪念Shincheonji创始人？没门！“，”清平公民不会被新天地集团的“神圣之地”和其他口号所愚弄，并高喊他们拒绝允许建造新天地博物馆。

Since April 7, Shincheonji members have been distributing leaflets in Cheongpyeong-myeon with the message “If we build a peace museum, not a religious facility, it will help the local economy,” and engaging in activities such as street cleaning, in an effort to overturn negative public opinion. A Shincheonji rally on the 15th mobilized 2,000 believers.

自4月7日起，新天地成员一直在清平面散发传单，上面写着“如果我们建立一个和平博物馆，而不是一个宗教设施，它将有助于当地经济”，并努力从事街道清洁等活动。推翻负面舆论。15日的新天地集会动员了2000名信徒
